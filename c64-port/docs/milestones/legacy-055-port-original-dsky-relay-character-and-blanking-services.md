Native DSPIN,11DSPIN and2BLANK match all 4,096 complete 2,048-word original-source images plus SUPER/IRQ, SHA 65097a2bedb65f7a5ebf81f42b101107b2e51ced4ae5aed81fd510e05bef0180. The entry domain includes all eight retained erasable banks, ordinary caller returns and source character/sign/blank counts; original clean-positive-zero CCS holes remain explicitly excluded. Strict and sanitizer checks and 64 actual C64 source images pass. The 9,859-byte PRG uses zero additional zero page and 10 hardware / 9 software stack bytes. Earlier EB2-only proof artifacts are retained. See `docs/DSKY-PINBALL.md`.
